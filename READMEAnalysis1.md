| Cell retention rate | 85.1% |

### 2. Cell Filtering Results

Stringent quality control filters were applied to remove low-quality cells that could introduce noise in downstream analysis.

**Table 12: Cell Filtering Summary**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Initial cells | 683 |
| Cells removed (< 100 counts) | 102 |
| Final cells retained | 581 |
| **Cell retention rate** | **85.1%** |

### 3. Gene Filtering Results

Genes expressed in fewer than 10 cells were removed to focus on reliably detected genes and reduce computational burden.

**Table 13: Gene Filtering Summary**
| Metric | Value |

This filtered dataset provides a robust foundation for subsequent normalization and cell type identification analysis.

## Normalization

Standard log normalization was applied to prepare the data for downstream analysis. This approach is particularly suitable for Botryllus data due to limited gene annotation and cross-species mapping challenges.

**Table 17: Normalization Summary**
| Step | Method | Purpose | Result |
|------|--------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Total count normalization | Remove sequencing depth variation | Target: 10,000 counts/cell |
| 2 | Log transformation log(x+1) | Variance stabilization | Log-scale expression values |

**Table 18: Normalization Rationale for Non-Model Organisms**
| Factor | Why Log Normalization |
|--------|----------------------|
| Limited annotation (25.4%) | Robust, assumption-free method |
| High sparsity (38.4% sparse genes) | Handles zero inflation effectively |
| Cross-species mapping | Reduces technical artifacts |

The normalized dataset maintains 581 cells × 14,658 genes with standardized expression values ready for dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis.

## Highly Variable Gene Selection and Stability Validation

### 1. Highly Variable Gene Identification

Following normalization, highly variable genes (HVGs) were identified to focus downstream analysis on genes that drive biological variation across cells. This step is critical for reducing noise and computational burden while preserving biologically meaningful signals in the Botryllus brain dataset.

**Table 19: Highly Variable Gene Selection Parameters**
| Parameter | Value | Biological Rationale |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| Minimum mean expression | 0.0125 | Exclude very lowly expressed genes prone to technical noise |
| Maximum mean expression | 3.0 | Exclude ubiquitously high housekeeping genes |
| Minimum dispersion | 0.5 | Select genes with substantial cell-to-cell variability |
| Selection method | Seurat-style | Robust method for cross-species data |

### 2. Quantitative HVG Selection Results

### 5. Quality Control Metrics in PCA Space

Analysis of technical quality metrics in principal component space validates the absence of systematic technical biases driving the major axes of variation.

**Table 32: Technical Bias Assessment in PC Space**
| Quality Metric | PC1-PC2 Distribution | Biological Interpretation |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Total UMI counts** | Broad, continuous distribution | No systematic count bias |
| **Gene detection** | Variable across PC space | Reflects cellular diversity |
| **Regional representation** | Both B2 and AB completely intermixed | No region-specific technical artifacts |
| **Overall pattern** | Technical metrics independent of PCs | Biological signal dominates |

**Technical Validation Results:**
- **No count bias**: UMI counts distribute evenly across PC space without clustering
- **Gene detection variance**: Reflects biological rather than technical differences
- **Regional equivalence**: Complete B2/AB intermixing confirms absence of regional batch effects
- **Signal purity**: Major PCs driven by cellular rather than technical variation

### 6. Regional Separation Analysis in PCA Space

Examination of brain region distribution in principal component space reveals **complete overlap** between B2 and AB regions, indicating **no detectable regional differences** in gene expression patterns.

**Table 33: Regional Distribution in PC Space**
| Brain Region | PC1-PC2 Pattern | Separation Quality |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **B2 Region (Orange)** | Completely intermixed across all PC space | No regional clustering |
| **AB Region (Blue)** | Thoroughly overlapping with B2 distribution | No separation detectable |
| **Overall Pattern** | Complete regional intermixing | **No regional gene expression differences** |

**Regional Analysis Findings:**
- **Complete overlap**: B2 and AB cells are thoroughly intermixed throughout PC1-PC2 space
- **No regional clustering**: No areas of PC space show enrichment for either region
- **Shared cellular architecture**: Both regions contain equivalent cell type distributions
- **Biological equivalence**: Major sources of variation are cell-type rather than region-based

**Biological Implications:**
- **Conserved brain organization**: B2 and AB regions represent functionally equivalent brain areas
- **Cell-type driven variation**: Primary axes of variation reflect cellular identity rather than anatomical location
- **Developmental consistency**: Similar developmental programs operate across brain regions
- **Functional homogeneity**: Both regions likely serve equivalent roles in Botryllus neural function


### 7. PCA Quality Assessment and Validation

**Table 35: PCA Analysis Quality Metrics**
| Quality Aspect | Assessment | Evidence |
|----------------|------------|----------|
| **Variance capture** | ✓ Appropriate | 19.1% in first 10 PCs |
| **Component selection** | ✓ Robust | Multiple methods converge at PC10 |
| **Technical bias control** | ✓ Excellent | Quality metrics independent, no regional bias |
| **Biological signal** | ✓ Strong | Cell-type driven variation patterns |
| **Computational efficiency** | ✓ Optimal | ARPACK solver performance |


The PCA analysis provides a robust foundation for downstream cell type clustering analysis, with high confidence that the retained components capture meaningful cellular variation while minimizing technical noise. The absence of regional differences suggests that B2 and AB represent equivalent functional brain units in Botryllus.

## Dimensional Reduction and Embedding Analysis

### 1. UMAP Parameter Optimization Strategy

Following PCA analysis, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was employed to create two-dimensional embeddings optimized for cell type discovery. A systematic parameter optimization approach was implemented to identify optimal settings for the Botryllus brain scRNA-seq dataset.

### 3. Selected UMAP Configurations

Based on comprehensive assessment, two complementary UMAP embeddings were generated to capture different aspects of cellular organization:

**Table 39: Final UMAP Configuration Comparison**
| Configuration | Parameters | Strengths | Use Case |
|---------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Cosine-based** | n_neighbors=35, metric='cosine' | Highest silhouette (0.634), expression pattern focus | **Primary analysis** |
| **Euclidean-based** | n_neighbors=15, metric='euclidean' | Highest composite score (0.620), magnitude sensitivity | **Comparative validation** |

### 4. UMAP Embedding Analysis

The euclidean-based embedding (n_neighbors=15, metric='euclidean') provides complementary perspective on cellular organization.

**Table 41: Euclidean UMAP Characteristics**
| Feature | Assessment | Biological Interpretation |
|---------|------------|--------------------------|
| **Cluster separation** | Very good (silhouette=0.599) | Moderate cell type boundaries |
| **Expression magnitude sensitivity** | High | Captures absolute expression differences |
| **Local structure** | Excellent preservation (0.719) | Fine-grained cellular relationships |
| **Regional effects** | Slightly enhanced (mixing=0.335) | Detects expression magnitude differences |

### 5. Comparative Embedding Analysis

Visual inspection of both UMAP embeddings reveals distinct organizational principles captured by different distance metrics.

**Table 42: Embedding Comparison Analysis**
| Aspect | Cosine Embedding | Euclidean Embedding | Biological Significance |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Cluster compactness** | Moderate, well-defined | Tight, distinct clusters | Both suitable for cell typing |
| **Gene expression gradients** | Smooth transitions | Sharp boundaries | Different sensitivity to expression levels |
| **Outlier cells** | Integrated into neighborhoods | More isolated positioning | Cosine better handles expression variability |
| **Overall structure** | Branched, tree-like | More scattered, discrete | Reflects different biological relationships |

**Key Observations from Visual Analysis:**
- **Cosine embedding**: Shows clear clustering structure with 6-8 major cell groups and smooth expression gradients
- **Euclidean embedding**: Displays more discrete clusters with sharper boundaries and distinct outlier populations
