| Factor | Why Log Normalization |
|--------|----------------------|
| Limited annotation (25.4%) | Robust, assumption-free method |
| High sparsity (38.4% sparse genes) | Handles zero inflation effectively |
| Cross-species mapping | Reduces technical artifacts |

The normalized dataset maintains 581 cells × 14,658 genes with standardized expression values ready for dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis.

## Highly Variable Gene Selection and Stability Validation

### 1. Highly Variable Gene Identification

Following normalization, highly variable genes (HVGs) were identified to focus downstream analysis on genes that drive biological variation across cells. This step is critical for reducing noise and computational burden while preserving biologically meaningful signals in the Botryllus brain dataset.
